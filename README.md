# min-cost-climbing-stairs
This code solves the “Minimum Cost Climbing Stairs” problem using three approaches:  Recursion: Simple but slow (exponential time).  Memoization: Caches results → efficient O(n).  Tabulation: Iterative DP → most efficient O(n).  Each approach calculates the minimum cost required to reach top by choosing the cheapest path of 1 or 2 steps at a time.
